ðŸ‘‹ hi there! my name's 487164.

we can talk wherever it suits you best: by email (you can encrypt it with /pgp-public.key.txt), telegram, or mastodon.

if you prefer to take a quick look at what i have published there, you can read what i write in my blog (it's in spanish only atm) or check what i've been doing for a living on mnf.red/487164.

to earn a living, i rent out my work by the hour (we can [find a spot for you](https://calendar.app.google/EqU4dvonG2VbUheF7)) to a tech company. i've always worked in this sector until now.

also, for a long time now and still to this day, i continue to play chess (go ahead and play a correspondence game!), from time to time i play video games (very few), i read a few books each year, i watch at least one movie or series almost every month and i listen to music practically every week of my life.

would you like to start a conversation? i'm [waiting for your message](mailto:487164@artiga.es)! ðŸ˜Š
